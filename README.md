# polybar-dracula
Polybar config for Dracula theme.

Current config all active modules working fine with Arch Linux 5.9.14-arch1-1 Kernel using KWIN as WM and Kronkite for tiling.

Note - KDE-Desktop module scripts created by Dadrophenia. With this module enabled, CPU usage on my machine is considerably higher than without, due to the script polling on 0.5 intervals.
